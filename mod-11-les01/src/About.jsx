                    <p>Welcome to my profile. I am a fearsome king of the jungle (or at least my house).
                        I love hunting bugs, but also hate meat, dairy, or anything that isn't my kibble or
                        arugula (yeah, it's random, but it works for me). My servants occasionally wonder if
                        I'm trying to be vegan. It's actually that I'm a bunny trapped in a cat body. 
                    </p>
